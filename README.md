# Royalty NFTs

## Coded with:

- Solidity
- Javascript (Web3.js, Truffle)

An example project I made of a set of NFT smart contracts that pay royalties to the original artist whenever the NFT is exchanged (sold) between wallets. These royalties are at the level of the smart contract of the NFT itself, rather than at the level of the marketplace. The smart contracts for this project are coded in Solidity. The deployment of these contracts are coded in Javascript, connecting to the blockchain using Web3.js, and the framework Truffle.
